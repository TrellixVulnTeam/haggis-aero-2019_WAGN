* FTS
	* ~~edit ardupilot circle mode~~
	* Program circle as FTS in mission-planner
	* Test
* Parachute deployment
	* Use pins in the reciever and input the voltage handling system int the groundstation: See http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-gripper-servo.html for the servo example. Using a linear actuator should be a simpler version of the same method
* Payload drop
